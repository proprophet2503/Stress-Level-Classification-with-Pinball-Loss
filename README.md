Flexible Pinball Loss SVM for Student Stress Monitoring

This repository implements a Flexible Pinball Loss Function integrated into a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for classifying student stress types.
The goal of the project is to analyze psychological, physiological, academic, environmental, and social factors that influence college students' stress levels and improve robustness of SVM classification using an adjustable pinball loss.
